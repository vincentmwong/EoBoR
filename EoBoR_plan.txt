THE BASIC QUESTION:
    How did the Reddit ban of 2015 affect the communities around the ban?

General goal:
    Construct a network from before, (during), and after the 2015 ban, using users from the banned subreddits.

What is the network?:
    Nodes are users
    Edges are whether they commented on the same thread
    	  If that's too much or too little, change it as needed
    This will need to include people who 

What are you looking for?:
    Did the network fragment after the ban? (Number of connect components)
    Did communities become more tight-knit after the ban? (Clustering coefficient)
    Did the communities become more disparate after the ban? (Assortativity)
    How many people left reddit altogether?
    How many people increased their interactions with users who posted in the associated subs?

Future work (basically, a list of stuff to avoid doing):
    Content analysis of the posts to understand if their behaviors changed
